20140620:
-Removed any telescope sync from spiral search (smc)
-Added import shutil to run_measure_seeing.py (smc)

20140611:
- Create hrstar_with_precess.py (same as hrstar.py with the addition of precession to the star coordinate changing them from EPOQ-2000 to EPOQ-NOW, ie 2014). (lc)
- Replace hrstar.best_star by hrstar_with_precess.best_star in pick_star.py at line 37. (lc)
- Modify all star coordinates in star.lst with 60s/60min value to be +1min/+1h. Otherwise it will bring an error within the astropy functions resulting in rejecting the star at line 40 in pick_star.py (lc)

20140627:
- Ran into the pier at the end of the night. Couldn't find new star so stayed on the current one (Fomalhaut - HR8728) and ended up tracking too low on the horizon >>> modified code to pick stars in the West, so that there is no risk of running into the pier, as the star already past the meridian:
	* changed pick_star.py (l.26) to start looking for a new star once the current star has airmass>1.15 (when zenith angle is over 30deg). (lc)
	* created hrstar_with_precess_WEST.py, to pick stars in the West. (lc)
	* Use hrstar_with_precess_WEST.Best_star in pick_star.py (l.39). (lc)
	* Modified goto_hr.py to implement precession (l.8,25,31,37). When
calling it one need to make sure that current_object got the right HR number
and need to specify the year of the current time as an argument (ie: python goto_hr.py 2014). (lc)

20140702:
- Telescope was powered on when openning ox-wagon for SkyCam, but not used for
seeing measurements (cloudy) hence it kept tracking till running into the pier
>>> modified code to prevent it from happening
>>> Added instruction in the wiki for opening Ox-wagon while not running seeing
measurements. (lc)
	* Added "./pygto900.py park" at the end of init/killmeasure_seeing/open
and close_oxwagon procedures in timdimm (l.33,61,73,78)
	* Added "./ox_wagon.py SCOPE", "./ox_wagon.py STATUS",
"./pygto900.py park_off", "./pygto900.py status" in run_measure_seeing.py (l17)
to make sure telescope is powered on and inparked before starting measurements.
	* Added "./pygto900.py status" in run_measure_seeing.py (l38) to keep
track of telescope position while measurements are done.
	* Added ./ox_wagon STATUS at the end of park to chack that telescope has
been powered off.

20140708:
- Add waiting time in Open/Close/Initialize/Park function of the timdimm GUI, to
allow for the ox-wagon to fully open and close. Also add instructions for not
sending 2 commands at the same time to ox-wagon and/or telescope and a status
check after each procedure to make sure telescope is always powered off.

The measure seeing procedure will start it up before doing measurements.
This way No special procedure is needed when using Ox-wagon but not TimDIMM.

The telescope will only get powered up when seeing measurement is run.
Stopping seeing measurement will also park and turn the telescope power off,
in the case seeing measurements are stopped for a long period of time due to
clouds/wind coming in.

20140902
-If alt is less than 30, then sends the park command before exiting
-Added check_image.py which takes a single image and displays it

20140904
-Removed all 'ox_wagon RESET' from the code so telescope stays off
-Added park telescope and unpark telescope when entering or exiting measure_seeing program in timdimm
-Changed pick stars to pass the telescope object instead of creating a new one
-Removed status so pick_stars is only asking for parameters of interest
